SQL is packed with functions that do all sorts of helpful stuff. Here are some of the most regularly used ones:

    COUNT() - returns the number of rows
    SUM() - returns the total sum of a numeric column
    AVG() - returns the average of a set of values
    MIN() / MAX() - gets the minimum/maximum value from a column

albums

AC/DC	Back in Black	1980	rock	50
Pink Floyd	The Dark Side of the Moon	1973	rock	45
