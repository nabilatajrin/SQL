If we want to delete all the rows, but leave the table itself, the proper command is TRUNCATE:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

In the case when we actually want to remove every trace of the table whatsoever, the DROP command comes into play:
DROP TABLE table_name;
Be very careful with these commands. There is no undo!
